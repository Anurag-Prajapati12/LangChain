# LangChain Learning Repository

This repository contains my hands-on learning and experiments with **LangChain** over the past few days.

## What I worked on
- Prompt templates & LLM calls
- Document loaders (Text, PDF, Web)
- Text splitting & chunking strategies
- Embeddings and vector stores (FAISS)
- Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG)
- Basic agents and tools

## Tech Stack
- Python
- LangChain
- LangChain Community
- FAISS
- OpenAI / HuggingFace APIs

## Purpose
This repository demonstrates my **continuous learning and practical implementation**
of LangChain concepts through small, focused scripts rather than only tutorials.
